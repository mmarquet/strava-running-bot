# Strava API Compliance & Data Usage

This document outlines how the Strava Running Bot complies with Strava's API terms and handles user data.

## ✅ Strava Branding Compliance

### Attribution Requirements

- **"Powered by Strava"** text appears in all Discord embeds and web pages
- **Strava logo** used in embed footers and web pages
- **Strava orange color** (#FC4C02) used consistently
- **Links to Strava** included where appropriate

### Visual Elements

- Discord embeds include Strava logo in footers
- Registration pages include proper Strava attribution
- Success/error pages include "Powered by Strava" branding

## 🔒 Data Privacy & Usage

### What Data We Access

- **Public Strava activities only** (runs, rides, etc.)
- **Basic athlete information** (name, profile picture)
- **OAuth tokens** (encrypted and stored securely)

### What We DON'T Access

- ❌ Private activities
- ❌ Followers-only activities  
- ❌ Personal messages or comments
- ❌ Detailed performance metrics beyond what's displayed
- ❌ Location data beyond activity maps

### Data Filtering

The bot automatically filters out:

- Private activities (`activity.private = true`)
- Followers-only activities (`activity.visibility = 'followers_only'`)
- Hidden activities (`activity.hide_from_home = true`)
- Flagged activities (`activity.flagged = true`)
- Activities older than 24 hours (for webhook posting)
- Short activities (less than 1 minute)
- Activities without distance (manual entries)

## 🔐 Data Security

### Token Management

- OAuth tokens encrypted with AES-256
- Automatic token refresh when needed
- Secure storage with encryption keys

### Access Control  

- Only processes data for registered team members
- Members can deactivate/remove themselves
- Admin controls for member management

## 📊 Rate Limiting

### ✅ Implementation Complete

- **Rate limiting**: ✅ Implemented with conservative limits
- **15-minute window**: 80 requests (Strava allows ~100)
- **Daily window**: 900 requests (Strava allows ~1000)  
- **Request queuing**: Automatic queuing when limits approached
- **Intelligent delays**: Calculates optimal wait times
- **Monitoring**: Rate limit stats in `/botstatus` command

### Strava API Limits

- **Official limits**: ~100 requests/15min, ~1000 requests/day
- **Our limits**: 80 requests/15min, 900 requests/day (conservative)
- **Queue management**: Requests queued when limits reached
- **Automatic retry**: Delayed execution with optimal timing

### Rate Limiter Features

- Real-time request tracking with sliding windows
- Automatic cleanup of expired request timestamps  
- Request queuing with FIFO processing
- Context-aware logging for debugging
- Stats available via Discord command and API

## 🎯 Usage Scope

### Intended Use

- **Team/club activity sharing** in Discord channels
- **Motivation and engagement** for running groups
- **Public activity celebration** and community building

### Data Retention

- Member data stored until manually removed
- No automatic data expiration (may need to implement)
- Tokens refreshed as needed to maintain access
